# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

> Part of The Odin Project Curriculum

This project is the grade-school-classic game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors"! 

To play:
 1. Go to: <https://will-pirtle.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/>
 2. Open Console in Developer Tools
 3. Enter `startGame();` to begin first (or a new) game.

*NOTE: At this time, the game is played completely through the console in the browser's developer tools. A later version of the game will implement a Graphical User Interface.

*UPDATE: The GUI is coming soon! A very basic user interface is up and running, however the styling is very simple (ugly) and is being polished up. Check out the 'gui' branch to view the code for these updates. STAY TUNED!
